		-"make clean" to clear all the *.c generated execuitable 	
	2) directions for running your code, 
		-./serial_ocean <xdim> <ydim> <timesteps> <value_to_be_assigned, 0 to take random value from 0-999> <matrix_printout "1/0>
	3) any other comments
		-"serial_ocean" does the serial implementation of the ocean simulation
		-"omp_ocean" does the dynamic parallel implementation of the ocean simulation
		-"omp_ocean_static" does the static parallel implemantation of the ocean simulation
		-"omp_ocean_static_increment" does the static parallel implementation of the ocean simulation
